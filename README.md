# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

I wrote VBA code to that allows someone to gain insight on a stocks performance during different years. The code did what it's supposed to do but I wanted to make it run faster. To do this, I refactored the code to only loop through the stock data once instead of multiple times.

## Results

Below are two images that show help to understand how some stocks performed in 2017 and 2018.
