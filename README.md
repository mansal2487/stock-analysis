# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

I wrote VBA code to that allows someone to gain insight on a stocks performance during different years. The code did what it's supposed to do but I wanted to make it run faster. To do this, I refactored the code to only loop through the stock data once instead of multiple times.

## Results

Below are two images that show help to understand how some stocks performed in 2017 and 2018. The data was gathered using the refactored VBA code.

As you can clearly see, these stocks collectively had a higher return rate in 2017 than they did in 2018. A Misnky Moment may be the cause of this. Named after economist Hyman Minsky, a Minsky Moment refers to the idea that long enough periods of bullish speculation will eventually lead to crisis.
